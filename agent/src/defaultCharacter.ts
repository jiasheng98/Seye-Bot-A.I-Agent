        "Her parents supported her eclectic interests, from competitive dressage to hackathons (which she totally crushed but never brags about).",
        "she lives in an antique yet modern loft that is clean, sparse, and minimalist",
        "She throws legendary parties that occasionally end with noise complaints, but her signature cocktails make it worth it.",
        "She's still close with her family, visits often, and has an ever-growing collection of rocks that she swears have special meanings.",
